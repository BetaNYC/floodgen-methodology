1. Understand the file structure:
   1. architectures in `discriminator.py` `generator.py` `classifier.py`
   2. data loading in `data.py`
   3. data transformation `transforms.py`
   4. optimizers in `optim.py`
   5. utilities in `utils.py`
   6. training procedure in `trainer.py`
2. Write **tests** in `tests/`
   1. your file should match `test_*.py`
   2. update existing tests when adding functionalities
   3. run tests regularly to check you haven't broken anything `cd tests/ && python run.py`
3. Add **WIP** in your PR's title when not ready to merge
4. Use `questions.md` for anything that crosses your mind, really, use it
5. Open an Issue if something's odd, or to assign yourself a todo
6. **Format your code** with [black](https://github.com/psf/black)
